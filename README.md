# brush_converter

A tool for converting digital brush formats between different painting applications.

It translates brushes into a readable JSON format which can then be converted into various application-specific brush formats.

Many popular brush formats are proprietary and undocumented, making it difficult to reuse brushes outside their original software.


## Formats

Conversion between formats may result in loss of detail. Brush settings may not be readable or may be incompatible with other software.

Applications currently supported:
- GIMP
- Medibang Paint

This project hopes to eventually support converting between these applications:
- Clip Studio Paint
- GIMP
- IbisPaint
- Medibang Paint
- Photoshop
- Procreate
